# Solana Metaplex Core NFT Minting

This repo details the steps involved in developing and minting Metaplex Core NFTs on the Solana blockchain, offering a thorough guide for developers or businesses interested in NFT creation within the Solana ecosystem.

Metaplex has introduced a new lightweight NFT standard on Solana, known as Metaplex Core. This guide will explain what Metaplex Core is, its significance, and how to mint your first NFT using Metaplex Core alongside the Umi JavaScript library.

## What is Metaplex Core?

Metaplex Core is a lightweight Solana NFT standard that leverages a single-account design. This design allows for more efficient execution, lower minting costs, and increased composability. The original Metaplex standard is built on top of Solanaâ€™s SPL token standard, which requires many accounts to mint an NFT (e.g., token account, metadata account, and master edition accounts).
